A roadmap for realizing a local-first and offline-first cyberspace

## Why?

Virtual Reality is currently comprised of a bunch of large silos. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Valve, and other such companies are all trying to control what people can and can't do in VR. As a user, you have to choose to buy a specific platform and limit what you can consume, and as a creator you have to jump through a bunch of hoops and pay for licences in order to create and share things.

This sucks.

[WebXR](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/) flips this on it's head. Instead of targeting specific platforms, creators can create experiences using websites and have them work on any headset that has a web browser which implements the WebXR spec (all of them). You don't need to buy into a specific set of APIs on a specific platform, you don't have to worry about app stores sitting between what you created and users, and you can instead focus on making weird stuff and sharing it with people. There's some limitations in that web browsers and JavaScript add a bit more overhead and might get in the way of using the hardware to it's fullest, but I beleive it's not so high that you can't create meaningful experiences, and that the freedom people get is usually worth it.

But it's not enough.

So, publishing content across platforms is cool, but the actual act of publishing and the interaction with this content is still limited by a key feature of the web: Creating and Hosting servers.
