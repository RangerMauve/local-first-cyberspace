## Summary

Virtual and augmented reality is going to enable a whole new way for people to create and share content with each other.
The current state of VR is controlled by a few large corporations which makes it harder to create things and share them with people.
The web helps here since almost every platform supports web browsers with WebXR APIs, this means that developers dont' have to worryy as much about specific platforms and app stores and can share their idea or experience with folks regardless of what headset or operating system they have.
Although the web helps creators publish stuff, it requires people to now maintain infrastructure to keep their content online.
Now your gatekeeper becomes hosting providers and you need to create accounts and have someone else control your content in addition to creating it.
Local first software and the decentralized web help here in that you don't need to worry about setting up servers. You can create something on your machine and share it with your friends directly over a peer to peer network.
This also gives you the freedom to remix other people's work and build on top of thing without needing to go through an asset store or some sort of higher level platform.
